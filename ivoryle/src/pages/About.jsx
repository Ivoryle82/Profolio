              <p>Hi there,
                I'm Ivory Le, or as my nickname goes - Bong. Welcome to QuaMatBong, which means "Through Ivory Eyes." This is more than just a platformâ€”it's my canvas. It's where I get to share my story with you.

              <p>
                Growing up in the heart of Hanoi, Vietnam, life was a vibrant tapestry of sights, sounds, and smells. Surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the city, I found solace in the simple things: the wagging tails of my two beloved puppies, the comforting aroma wafting from my family's coffee shop, and the fresh flowers my mom brought home every morning.
              </p>
              <p>
                In these moments, I learned the art of appreciation. I learned to see beauty in the everyday, to cherish the small joys that make life so precious. And from a young age, I knew I wanted to capture it all.
